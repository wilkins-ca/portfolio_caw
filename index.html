                <h1>Hi, my name's Celia</h1>
                <h3>It's nice to meet you</h3>
                <h3>Welcome to my portfolio~</h3>

                I got into design because I love to make things. From crocheting and photography to coding and design, 
                I love to be creative and puzzle out all that needs to be done for a project.
                I started with Cornell University's UI/UX Design program, got into some workshops, and from 
                there it was just about getting my hands dirty with projects of my own, such as this website. 
                I'm always ready for a new challenge, and hope you have as much fun looking though my projects as 
                I did throughout the process of building them.
