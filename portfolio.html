                <!-- insert summary of project followed by notes on a few design choices here -->
                I needed to make a portfolio in order to establish myself as a designer, and it needed to 
                be online so as to be accessible everywhere. It also served as a good project in and of 
                itself, so I took to working on a concept that would best showcase my experience, my style, 
                and my ability to teach myself new things. I decided simpler is better, and the goal is 
                elegance, so I kept only the most vital links, and made sure they were readily apparent 
                at the top of the screen. This includes putting the blurb about myself on 
                the main page rather than a separate page, since we want to draw attention to it and make 
                it very accessible. I considered setting a background image, originally thinking it would 
                add to the elegance, then decided against it, since it could be distracting, and went with 
                a color scheme instead. I also chose a Times New Roman font since the serifs add more decoration, 
                but it's still very legible.
